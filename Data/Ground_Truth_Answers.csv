2464,Answer D:  About 50% of people with hypertension are controlled
2465,Answer A:  Increased long-term BP variability is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events despite adequate BP control on most visits
2466,Answer D:  Low dietary potassium promotes hypertension by increasing the activity of the sodium-chloride cotransporter (on a high sodium diet)
2467,Answer D:  Add amiloride
2468,Answer B:  In 1 year
2469,Answer B:  Obtain 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring
2470,Answer D:  Add spironolactone
2471,"Answer B:  Home BP tele-monitoring supervised by a health care provider results in higher rates of BP control than usual care Home BP monitoring, with or without remote telemonitoring, is associated with better BP control; therefore, choice B is correct, and choice A is incorrect. The best results occur when a healthcare provider, such as a physician, clinical pharmacist, or nurse, pairs the monitoring with interventions. Protocols involving patient education for self-titration of therapy are also quite effective for individuals with hypertension regardless of comorbid conditions, but it is estimated that only about 20% of hypertensive patients may be suitable to this intervention (incorrect choices C and D). Financial incentives to physicians result in modest increases in rates of BP control in hypertensive patients (incorrect choice E)."
2472,Answer D:  110/75 mmHg
2473,Answer A:  Droxidopa
2474,Answer D:  Make no changes to the current regimen
2475,Answer D:  Her BMI
2476,Answer C:  Inappropriately low atrial natriuretic peptide levels
2477,"Answer D:  Regular use of continuous positive airway pressure for at least 4 hours per night Patients with obesity have an increased incidence of both sleep apnea and resistant hypertension. A recent study has shown that the combination of weight loss with regular use of CPAP improves BP and can reverse abnormal dipping patterns. The effects of CPAP on BP are also more pronounced with use of CPAP for more than 4 hours per night; hence, choice D is correct. Use of nocturnal oxygen supplementation has not been shown to be effective to reduce BP (choice A is incorrect). Behavioral and self-help psychotherapy are not effective in lowering BP as assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (choice B is incorrect). A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial and a meta-analysis of device-guided breathing by Landman and coworkers found no benefit of device-guided breathing in lowering BP; thus, choice C is incorrect."

2488,"Answer D:  Add amlodipine, targeting a systolic BP of <120 mmHg "
2489,"Answer C:  The low BP target (120 mmHg) resulted in a 38% reduction in the risk of heart failure In SPRINT, a systolic BP target of <120 mmHg, compared to a target of 140 mmHg, resulted in lower risk of several cardiovascular endpoints as well as all-cause death. Specifically, the composite endpoint of myocardial infarction and other coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death was decreased by 25%. This was driven largely by less heart failure (38%) and cardiovascular deaths (22%). All cause death was also decreased by 27%. Other components of the endpoint were also improved, but did not reach statistical significance (stroke was decreased by 11%, P=0.50, and myocardial infarction was decreased by 17%, P=0.19; other coronary syndromes were identical between the two groups). All subgroups benefited from the lower target, including patients older than 75 years. The differences between the two groups were substantial (15/8 mmHg at 12 months) an dpersisted for the duration of the trial. The risk of AKI was increased by 71% in the low BP target group, but the absolute risk was 4.4% (vs. 2.6% in the standard group, P<0.001).  "
2490,Answer C:  Refer for percutaneous renal angioplasty
2491,Answer E:  25OHD replacement has no effect on BP in hypertensive patients with 25OHD deficiency
2492,"Answer C:  Beetroot juice lowers ambulatory BP by about 8/5 mmHg compared with placebo Beetroot juice is a good source of nitrates, resulting in BP lowering through the provision of nitrates that result in vasodilatation, improved endothelial function, and lower BP (-7.7/5.2 mmHg on 24h ABPM). There is no known effect of beetroot juice on aldosterone. In the available clinical studies, the effect was sustained at least up to 4 weeks. Pulse wave reflections have not been studied with beetroot therapy, but pulse wave velocity tends to decrease, thus suggesting that wave reflection would also likely decrease. There are no reports of hypertension associated with beetroot juice."

2511,Answer C:  Enalapril
2512,"Answer B:  She should start aspirin 81 mg daily immediately after pregnancy is diagnosed Approximately one in three women who have received a kidney transplant develop preeclampsia during pregnancy. Therefore, prophylaxis with low-dose aspirin is appropriate. In addition, heightened antenatal surveillance should be offered, including fetal growth and Doppler monitoring starting at 28 weeks gestation. The majority of women with kidney transplants are delivered by caesarean section. However, the indications for surgical delivery are the standard obstetric maternal or fetal indications, and vaginal delivery is not contraindicated. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Mycophenolate mofetil should be changed to azathioprine at least 3 months prior to attempting to conceive, to ensure graft stability; hence, option C is incorrect. Risk factors for adverse graft outcomes include hypertension, pre-pregnancy serum creatinine levels >1.5 mg/dl, and black ethnicity. There is no evidence to support an increased incidence of graft rejection after delivery, therefore commencing prednisone postpartum (option D) is incorrect."

2869,Answer B:  Gram-negative blood stream infections have been reported with hemodialyzer reuse Educational objective:  Know the risks of hemodialyzer reuse
2870,"Answer D:  Assess whether continuing dialysis is less detrimental than withholding treatment Educational objective:  Appropriately respond to abnormal dialysate bacterial culture results  The Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS) End-Stage Renal Disease Interpretive Guidance does not indicate that hemodialysis treatment must be terminated when allowable water quality levels have been exceeded. The maximum allowable bacterial level is 200 colony forming units per ml. Dialyzers act as an efficient ultrafilter and bacteria, fungi, and viruses are excluded from crossing the dialyzer membrane. At an absorptive capacity and molecular weight cutoff of 25-30 kilodaltons, intact dialyzer membranes protect patients cross-over of viable bacteria from dialysate to blood. In addition, current dialysis machines often incorporate a secondary ultrafilter in the dialysate pathway that adds additional protection from bacterial exposure. The physician must assess the most appropriate action is  optimal for each patient. Therefore, option D is correct. For example, a clinician may have to decide whether withholding dialysis on a patient requiring massive fluid removal or electrolyte control is more detrimental than continuing dialysis with a bacterial level above the maximum level. CMS regulation stipulates “The use of water outside of AAMI standards should be extremely rare. The medical director is ultimately responsible for this decision; short term exposure to contaminants is limited to one treatment, rather than not receiving dialysis may be the optimal choice.” Bacteria in dialysis water could result in the presence of endotoxin and endotoxin fragments. The possible continuous exposure to endotoxin and endotoxin fragments could result in pyrogenic reactions and other inflammatory responses. In the setting of dialyzer reuse (where dialyzers are rinsed and reprocessed using reverse osmosis processed water), bacterial contamination of the water distribution system has resulted in patient bloodstream infections. Prophylactic antibiotics would be ineffective in mitigating the inflammatory response as a result from improperly maintained water quality and would result in unnecessary antibiotic exposure (option A is incorrect). Blood cultures would not detect the presence of endotoxin or endotoxin fragments (option B is incorrect). Decreasing dialysis and blood flow or changing to a different hemodialysis machine would not avert exposure to endotoxin and endotoxin fragments (options C and E are incorrect). Bacterial contamination must be addressed by chemical disinfection of the water distribution system, following by retesting of bacterial colony counts and endotoxin levels. If the problem persists and/or continues despite multiple rounds of disinfection, more aggressive action may be needed to eliminate bacterial contamination or replace the contaminated water system."

Choice D is correct because isolated diastolic hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiac events (choices A is incorrect) and requires treatment (incorrect option B). This risk is less than systo-diastolic or isolated systolic hypertension (option C is incorrect). If his office diastolic BP was in the 90-99 mmHg range, he would fall under the umbrella of “mild” hypertension, a subgroup with uncertain long-term benefits from treatment in the absence of diabetes. However, this definition applies to office BP; there are no data defining thresholds for treatment of “mild hypertension” based on home or 24-h ambulatory BP readings.

pregnancies in women without CKD. Women with stage 1 CKD and a systemic disease (type 1 diabetes
mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, or kidney transplantation) had an increased risk for preterm delivery.
Hence, option C is correct. The authors found that mild decrements in eGFR in the “normal range” were found
to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, even in the absence of hypertension and proteinuria. Hence,
option A is incorrect. Given the history of increased albuminuria, lisinopril should be continued until the time of
conception; thus, option B is incorrect. Poor glycemic control adversely affects fetal outcomes, and has been
associated with an increased risk for cardiac and neural tube defects. The American Diabetes Association
recommends maintenance of HbA1c levels <7.0% prior to conception. Statins are considered FDA Category X,
indicating that animal studies or human studies have demonstrated risk to the fetus. Therefore, option D is
incorrect."
5817,"A. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 studies (10 randomized controlled trials), involving 751 participants was
recently published. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were used as standard-of-care in recent
studies, despite only a trend to improvement in graft survival. Together with plasmapheresis and IVIG, rituximab did not
add benefit, and there was insufficient data supporting the use of bortezomib. While heterogeneity in treatments,
definition of antibody-mediated rejection
(AMR), quality, and follow-up all limit firm conclusions regarding best treatment practices, plasmapheresis and IVIG
remain the most evidence-based regimen for AMR. Therefore, option A is correct, and the other listed options are
incorrect."
5693,"C. Treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with better BP control and reductions in cardiovascular
outcomes, as compared with other first-line agents for management of hypertension.
LEGEND-HTN used a big data approach to analyze administrative claims and electronic health record databases to
identify patients initiating antihypertensive medications, and assess clinical outcomes. This study found that as compared
with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin
receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics were associated with better BP control and reduced rates of cardiovascular events
including hospitalization for heart failure, stroke and myocardial infarction (C).
This study also found inferior outcomes in patients treated with nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (A) as a
first-line agent. Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorthiazide had similar effects on rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure,
and stroke, but treatment with chlorthalidone was associated with higher rates of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and acute
kidney injury (B).
Wei et al. performed a meta-analysis of 46 clinical trials of treatment of hypertension. In contrast to LEGEND-HTN, this
particular analysis showed that ACE inhibitors, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics were
similarly effective in reducing overall cardiovascular events. It also found that ACE inhibitors were most effective in
reducing risk of myocardial infarction (D)."
5474,"B. Exercise-associated hyponatremia
Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) results from an acute fall in serum Na+ concentration ([Na+]) to <135 mmol/L
that occurs during or up to 24 hours after prolonged exercise or endurance activity. EAH has a common pathogenesis of
fluid intake more than required, which is usually coupled with non-osmotically and inappropriately elevated AVP
concentrations. Symptomatic EAH can lead to death; therefore, appropriate treatment with hypertonic saline is essential to
improve outcomes and prevent death caused by cerebral edema and brain herniation. A is incorrect because dehydration is
defined by an increase, not decrease, in serum [Na+]. C, D and E are incorrect since heat illness, hypoxia and volume
depletion are unlikely contributors to presentation based on her vital signs."
5478,"B. Decreased thirst in response to hypertonicity in the elderly.
This patient was administered tolvaptan, a V2 receptor antagonist, for improving his chronic hyponatremia. His diet
related QOL and appetite improved, because he did not have to either observe fluid restriction or take a large amount of
urea, which has a bitter taste. In initiating tolvaptan, he was advised to drink enough water to satisfy his thirst whenever
he felt thirsty to prevent hypernatremia, and he followed this advice.
Older adults are less likely to feel thirst and have a narrower dynamic range of thirst than younger people. In other words,
with respect to water deficiency in the body, thirst is slaked with relatively less hydration than in younger people. As a
result, the amount of water consumed may be insufficient to compensate for water deficiency in the body. In clinical
practice for the correction of hyponatremia, attention should be paid to this important aspect in the elderly. Answer A is
incorrect as aquaresis would not cause hypernatremia in the setting of an intact thirst response. C and D are incorrect,
since the text states that he had a good appetite and was instructed to drink ad libitum. E is not the best answer given
rapidity of overcorrection of serum [Na+].

5490,"C. A mutation in the SCNA4 gene for the alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle cell sodium channel.
Acute transient hyperkalemia suggests an abnormality of potassium distribution not excretion. His history of onset in early
childhood and family history suggests a heritable condition. The most likely heritable condition resulting in transient
hyperkalemia associated with periodic muscle weakness is hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, which is an autosomal
dominant disorder caused by a point mutation in the SCNA4 gene for the alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle cell sodium
channel.
A, B and D are not correct. Loss of function mutations of ENaC and mutations of WNK, genes encoding Kelch-like 3 and
Cullin 3, (which increase expression and/or activity of NCC) cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (also known as
Gordon syndrome or familial hyperkalemic hyperkalemia) with chronic hyperkalemia and often hyperkalemic metabolic
acidosis."

B. A deep learning algorithm using an electrocardiogram is able to exclude hyperkalemia with acceptable accuracy
A deep learning algorithm using electrocardiogram (ECG) is able to exclude hyperkalemia with acceptable accuracy.
Artificial intelligence and deep learning models are being studied to detect ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia. In
one study a deep learning model was trained to detect potassium >5.5 mEq/L using >1.5 million ECGs from 449,380
patients and tested in a validation cohort including 61,965 CKD patients. Using a high sensitivity operating point to
maximize its utility as a screening tool, the negative predictive value was greater than 99%, which is as good or better
than many other commonly used screening tools.
A and C are incorrect. Potassium is measured from serum after the collected blood is allowed to clot, a process that
releases potassium. As a result, serum potassium concentrations typically exceed plasma or whole blood measurements by
0.1-0.7 mM. Whole blood techniques measure potassium immediately after the sample is obtained, without further
processing.
D is incorrect. Although it is often argued that serum potassium is the most accurate measure, recent trials suggest that
whole blood potassium may be a more accurate measure of the relevant physiological variable than serum potassium."
5492,"C. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate also removes hydrogen ions and may increase serum bicarbonate
Data from three placebo-controlled trials demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in mean serum bicarbonate of 0.3 to 1.5
mM within 48 h of treatment with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These changes were maintained over 29 days. With
highest sodium zirconium cyclosilicate maintenance doses, the percentage of patients with serum bicarbonate <22 mM
declined from 39% at baseline to 4.9% at 29 days.
A is not correct. Zirconium cyclosilicate has been shown in randomized trials to reduce potassium in both dialysis and
nondialysis CKD patients.
B is not correct. The sodium load delivered with sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is substantial, and chronic use has been
associated with edema in more than 10% of patients, especially in those patients with eGFR <30 ml/minute.
D is not correct. Although zirconium cyclosilicate works quickly since it acts in both the small and the large intestines, it
has not been shown to provide added benefit to standard therapy, including insulin and glucose, for acute severe
hyperkalemia"
5501,". It was generated by metabolism of retained lactate to bicarbonate and should spontaneously correct
The patient developed lactic acidosis due to septic shock. Because of concern about the severe metabolic acidosis,
bicarbonate was administered, which returned pH toward normal, but with large amounts of circulating lactate. When the
patient became hemodynamically stable, the liver metabolized the circulating lactate to bicarbonate generating a
metabolic alkalosis. Because the patient’s hemodynamics are stable, he should correct the metabolic alkalosis as is
evidenced by the urine pH of 8. C is not the best answer. Although significant volume contraction could prolong duration
of alkalosis, restoration of stable hemodynamic parameters together with the urine pH of 8 suggest that he is volume
replete, excreting bicarbonate and correcting the alkalosis. A and B are unlikely given that prior lab values and blood
pressure have been normal.
The answer is found in section on Clinical conditions that cause metabolic alkalosis, subsection on Exogenous alkali gain."
5502,"C. Primary hyperaldosteronism
This patient presents with new onset of hypertension, which is noteworthy for the presence of a hypokalemic alkalosis in
the absence of any diuretics or signs of volume depletion. The key part of the workup is the measurement of plasma renin
and aldosterone. While renin and aldosterone levels need to be interpreted in the context of volume status, that is not the
case when renin is low, and aldosterone is high. The only explanation for this is primary hyperaldosteronism. B is
incorrect since renin levels would be high in renovascular disease. A is incorrect since patients with Gitelman Disease
present with high renin and high aldosterone, and usually low or normal blood pressure. D is incorrect as these patients
present with hypertension but with low renin and low aldosterone.
The most common causes for primary hyperaldosteronism are adrenal adenoma and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Other
possible causes are adrenal carcinoma and glucocorticoid suppressible hyperaldosteronism.
The correct answer is found in sections on Clinical Conditions that cause metabolic alkalosis, subsections on Increased
delivery of sodium, and increased distal transport activity"
5503,"B. Syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess due to glycyrrhizic acid
This patient presents with new onset of hypertension, which is noteworthy for the presence of a hypokalemic alkalosis in
the absence of any diuretics or signs of volume depletion. Once again, the key part of the workup is the measurement of
plasma renin and aldosterone. The low levels of renin and aldosterone point to an aldosterone-independent activation of
distal nephron Na+, K+, and H+ transport. The most common cause of this is Cushing’s syndrome, but the patient has no
evidence on physical examination and plasma cortisol is normal. Adrenogenital syndromes with elevation of
nonaldosterone mineralocorticoids would also be possible but is unlikely to present at age 35 and in the absence of any
findings. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is inhibition of 11-beta-HSD-2 which allows glucocorticoids to bind to and
activate the mineralocorticoid receptor. This could be due to a genetic disorder or more commonly due to glycyrrhizic
acid intake. Since certain brands of chewing tobacco contain glycyrrhizic acid, this is the most likely diagnosis. A and D
are incorrect as surreptitious diuretic use and villous adenoma (latter resulting in diarrhea) would both present with high
renin and high aldosterone levels: C is incorrect since primary hyperaldosteronism presents with low renin and high
aldosterone levels."
5531,"C. Obtain cystatin C level, continue abemaciclib, and repeat laboratory studies in 1 week
Abemaciclib has been associated with elevations in serum creatinine that usually occur with 28 days after starting the
treatment and generally remain elevated but stable for the duration of therapy. Abemaciclib inhibits renal creatinine
secretion, which leads to elevations in serum creatinine rather than a true kidney toxicity. Cystatin C is useful in this
setting as an alternative measure of GFR that is not affected by creatinine secretion.
Answer option (A) is incorrect. Bevacizumab nephrotoxicity manifests as new or worsening hypertension, proteinuria,
and in some cases AKI and TMA. Answer option (B) is incorrect. Denosumab is associated with hypocalcemia and other
electrolyte abnormalities but has not been shown to cause AKI. Answer option (D) is incorrect. Given that the rise in
serum creatinine is probably related to the decreased renal secretion, abemaciclib can be continued with careful
monitoring."
5617,"A. Her age is a risk factor for not mounting an antibody response
Available results show a reduced SARS-CoV-2 IgG response (38%–54%) to two doses of mRNA vaccination in kidney
transplant recipients compared to healthy individuals (100%) and dialysis patients (90%). Factors reported to be
associated with lower responses in KTR are older age, worse renal function, and use of triple immunosuppressive
medications including antimetabolites, especially higher doses of mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid (answer
options [B] and [C] are incorrect). Anti-thymocyte globulin treatment effect probably does not last for 4 years. A study
involving 101 solid organ transplant recipients reported a 40% antibody response after the 2nd dose of an mRNA
vaccination, which was increased to only 68% after a 3rd dose (answer options [E] and [D] are incorrect). A double-blind,
randomized, controlled trial of a third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) in 120 kidney transplant recipients without
previous history COVID-19 disease reported that the median percent virus neutralization was 71% in the mRNA-1273
group and 13% in the placebo group. Her age of 35 does not decrease her response to vaccination (answer option [A] is
correct)."
5626,"B. Careful office measurement followed by out-of-office measurement if BP is elevated
There are several important concepts to consider in making and confirming a diagnosis of hypertension. It is important to
look for both white-coat or office hypertension and masked hypertension in addition to sustained hypertension to decide
on the appropriate approach. The correct answer is to follow up an elevated office measurement with an out-of-office
measurement, preferably by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, but home measurements are also an option.
Answer option A is incorrect because it is likely the repeated readings will also be elevated, and this would not
discriminate between office hypertension and sustained hypertension.
Answer option C is incorrect because it would not be cost effective to order ambulatory BP monitoring as a screening
tool, even for patients with normal BP. This is complicated somewhat by the need to consider masked hypertension,
where office measurements may not be elevated but out of office readings are elevated. The 2017 ACC/AHA BP
guideline recommends considering ambulatory BP monitoring for patients with elevated BP, systolic BP 120–129 mm
Hg, or diastolic BP <80 mm Hg or when there is evidence for target organ damage but BP in the"
5661,"A. Add dapagliflozin 10 mg/day
Add dapagliflozin 10 mg /day. The Dapa-CKD trial, included 271 patients with IgA nephropathy, eGFR 25–75 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 and albuminuria 200–5000 mg/g creatinine At 2.4 years the risk of 50% eGFR decline or ESKD or death
from renal cause was lower in the dapagliflozin group versus placebo with no difference in benefit between diabetic and
non-diabetic patients. Among 270 patients with IgA nephropathy, the risk of the composite endpoint was lower in the
dapagliflozin group compared with placebo (4% versus 15%) (answer option A is correct).
Although the previous teaching was that patients without significant proteinuria and stable eGFR were unlikely to
progress, a retrospective study showed that among 145 patients with biopsy demonstrated IgA, almost 20% had
significant progression of chronic kidney disease over 22 years (answer option B is incorrect).
C and D are incorrect. The 2021 KDIGO guidelines suggests BP target <120 mm Hg systolic for all patients with
glomerulonephritis (answer options C and D are incorrect).
Even with conservative interpretation of consensus guidelines, this patient is treated to target on an optimal renoprotective
agent. The addition of joint therapy with an ACE inhibitor and ARB is not recommended."
2580,"Answer D: Even correcting for diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria, kidney stone formation is associated
with an increased risk of cardiovascular events
In a Cohort study of 3,195,452 people aged >18 years registered in the universal health care system in Alberta,
Canada, between 1997 and 2009, a total of 25,532 (0.8%) participants had at least one kidney stone, and 91,465
(3%) individuals had at least one cardiovascular event during follow-up. Compared with people without kidney
stones, and after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, albuminuria, and
other potential confounders, people who had at least one kidney stone had a higher risk of subsequent acute
myocardial infarction, the need for coronary revascularization, and stroke (option D is correct). The magnitude
of the excess risk associated with a kidney stone appeared more pronounced for younger people than for older
people (option C) and for women than men. Having more than one kidney stone did not appear to increase the
risk (option E)."
2584,"Answer C: Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis
The recent onset of abdominal pain, weight loss, and ultrafiltration failure should raise suspicion for
encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). This patient’s peritoneal equilibrium test shows an initial increase, and
then a decrease in the dialysate to plasma ratios (D/P) of creatinine, as well as loss of sodium sieving
characteristic of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. Figure 1 shows that the fall in the D/PNa+ ratio resulting
from a decrease in the dialysate sodium concentration that is observed in normal sodium sieving is no longer
apparent. Hence, option C is the best answer. Morelle and coworkers suggested that abnormal peritoneal
transport heralds the development of EPS. In a cohort of 234 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients at a single
academic center in Europe over a 20-year period, a total of 7 patients developed EPS. As part of routine care, a
modified 3.86% glucose PET was performed yearly. When compared with long-term PD patients who did not
develop EPS, affected patients showed an early decline in ultrafiltration. In fact, the accompanying loss of
sodium sieving was the most potent predictor for the development of EPS. In a careful pathologic analysis of
peritoneal biopsies, patients with EPS were found to have excessive vascular proliferation and fibrotic changes
when compared to uremic or long-term PD patients who did not develop EPS. Further microscopic imaging
revealed that the quantity and density of collagen was increased in patients with EPS when compared to
controls. Surprisingly, and despite the clinical hallmark of ultrafiltration failure, aquaporin-1 expression was
similar in patients with EPS compared to unaffected controls on PD. This led the authors to hypothesize that
specific changes in the peritoneal make up, specifically a diseased collagen matrix, causes the decrease in
osmotic conductance leading to ultrafiltration failure in EPS (rather than vasculopathy or the lack of aquaporin-
1). The incidence of EPS is variable, but only a minority of patients develops EPS even after prolonged courses
of peritoneal dialysis. Ultrafiltration failure due to a peritoneal dialysate leak (option A) or increased
lymphatic absorption (option B) is characterized by stable D/P urea and creatinine ratios over time, unlike the
results noted in this woman; therefore, options A and B are incorrect. Patients with ultrafiltration failure due to
high membrane transport characteristics have increased D/Pcreatinine ratios that exceed 0.8 and
D/Pglucose ratios that are <0.3; thus, option D is incorrect."
